    <h4><b>What do you enjoy the most about working in sales? /<br> What attracts you to working in sales? </b></h4> 
    <p>Helping people to bring valuable solutions to them. Sales, first and foremost, has a drive to fill the customer's need. This is also a reason why it is important to qualify leads, so that we approach the target customer and not someone who is not even able to use the solution.
