    <h4><b>What excites you about working at Locatee? </b></h4> 
    <p>During the last two years, the way we work and what spaces we occupy have been transformed. The idea of “less is more” comes into full force and being able to work for a company that fully understands this 180-degree turn fully excites me.</p> 

<p>In a sales position, it is essential to love what you sell. And being able to sell a solution that helps clients make the right moves will also ensure that I am making the right moves in my career, this time in Switzerland.</p> 

<p>During my personal and professional journey being a Brazilian open-hearted I got in touch with various different cultures and personalities with seems like a great fit into the diverse company culture of Locatee. And in case you don't have any Brazilians yet, you could increase the number of nationalities to 23.
