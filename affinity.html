    <h4><b>Tell us about your affinity to <br/> IT/Proptech/Startup</b></h4> 
    <p>When I moved to France, I had the pleasure to work under the direct responsibility of the director. This allowed me to perform with a lot of autonomy and lead to constant growth and great personal satisfaction.</p>

<p>Having a partner who works in an IT- startup has opened my perspective to this realm full of possibilities. <br/>
I saw similarities with some of the countless achievements of my career.</p>

<p>Daily exchanges with him allowed myself to understand that I perform better in an environment that allows both growing together and individual growth. Thatâ€™s why I now aim to work for a Startup company such as Locatee which encourages employees to think out of the box and always strive for the best.</p>
